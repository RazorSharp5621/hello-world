# hello-world
My very first Github repo . . . a "virginal" experience . . .

I am a human being.  I realize the obviosity (a new word?) of this since no other known things can create a Github repo--even one as simple as this.  Now that I think about it, I suppose a human being could write some automated process to do this and then my above statement might be wrong--but a reasonable person could argue that a human still did it.

Enough silliness.  On to the next step . . . .
